To use this playbook, supply ansible_ssh_host settings for the system and the
virtual system prefixed with rescue-, see the example inventory file. boot into
your rescue system and supply the ssh password in the inventory. you can also
set up the rescue system to use an ssh key, in that case remove the
ansible_ssh_pass setting for the rescue system.

Put the public SSH key with which you want to login into files/ansible_authorized_keys.

Configure the host as given in host_vars/examplehost, and let the playbook run:

 $ time ansible-playbook provision-nfs-mbr.yml --diff -v --sudo --limit examplehost

Obviously, this will wipe that host, so be carefull and better read the
playbook first...
